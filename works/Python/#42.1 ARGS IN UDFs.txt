#CLASSICAL METHOD:
def a(a,b,c,d):
    print(f"student 1:{a}\nstudent 2:{b}\nstudent 3:{c}\nstudent 4:{d}")
a("harry","rohan","lavaris","jeevam")
#MODERN METHOD:
def f(y,*z):
    print(y)
    print(type(z))
    print(z[0])
    print(z)
    for i in z:
        print(i)
h="good"
e=["harry","rohan","lavaris","jeevam"]
f(h,*e)#it will go as tuple and normal argument can only be placed before *e or it will give error
